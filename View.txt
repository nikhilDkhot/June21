Views are pseudo-tables. That is, they are not real tables; nevertheless appear as ordinary 
tables to SELECT. A view can represent a subset of a real table, selecting certain columns or 
certain rows from an ordinary table. A view can even represent joined tables. Because views are 
assigned separate permissions, you can use them to restrict table access so that the users see 
only specific rows or columns of a table.

Since views are not ordinary tables, you may not be able to execute a DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE
statement on a view. However, you can create a RULE to correct this problem of using DELETE, 
INSERT or UPDATE on a view.

CREATE [TEMP | TEMPORARY] VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];

SELECT * FROM view_name;
